## Cowry Fast

* A simple api built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) that generates a key value pair containing a timestamp and a uuid and returns this list of all  previously generated key-values when the api endpoint is called.

* The database is instantiated as an empty list in a [stamp_uuid.json](https://github.com/E-wave112/cowry-fast/blob/main/stamp_uuid.json) file on which the dictionary response is appended to every time the api endpoint is called for persistence.

* This coding assessment is given by [Cowrywise](https://cowrywise.com/)

* please find the source code(s) for this coding assessment [here](https://github.com/E-wave112/cowry-fast/blob/main/stamp_uuid.py) and [here](https://github.com/E-wave112/cowry-fast/blob/main/application.py)
